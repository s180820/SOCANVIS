    "# Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems of some modern welfare states is a tendency of obesity [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following investigates potential factors in determining obesity in the United States of America, these factors are: **income**, **exposure to fastfood restaurants**, **physical health**, **mental health**, **gender(?)** and **education(?)**. The trend seems that the Americans every year spend more money on food-away-from-home, excluding 2020, however that year was also extraordinary in regards to lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However almost the same percentage of the american income is spend on food-away-from-home where food-at-home percentage spent is decreasing [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could maybe be caused by parts of the world, USA including, evolving to have more performance fixated mindsets where stress is more common. Since stress can be linked to obesity and today obesity can be considered an epidemy in USA [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following investigation will start by investigating potential factors which could affect obesity in different states or counties in USA, with the purpose of fitting a model to predict chances of obesity in regards to different features. \n",
