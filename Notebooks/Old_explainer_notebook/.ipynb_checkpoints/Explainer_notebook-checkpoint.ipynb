    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data sets\n",
    "The data used in this project consists of two data sets. One contains data from the conversation on Twitter surrounding Sarah Everard, and the other contains random sampled tweets by quering the neutral pronoun _I_. Our data sets contain 15 variables after cleaning and preprocessing and to name a few it contains the user's name, the text of the tweet, geographical location of the user and the predicted gender of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Twitter and why Sarah-data?\n",
    "<!--  - __Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?__  -->\n",
    "We have choosen Twitter as the platform from which we would like to study social interaction due to its user audience and its textbased interaction functionality. We chose to collect tweets based on the hashtag #SarahEverard to shed light on women's safety due to the case of her murder being current and a case of violence against women. The case revolves around the happening of an ordinary woman on her way home, not being safe in the streets of London. \n",
    "The reason for collecting the random data based on the pronoun _I_ being present in the tweet is based on it being non-biased and not related to one gender. It has also ranked the second most frequently used word on Twitter after the stopword _the_ (https://techland.time.com/2009/06/08/the-500-most-frequently-used-words-on-twitter/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The idea and goal of the project \n",
    "The idea for this final project emerged from the debate surrounding women's safety in relation to harrasment and violence against women. This debate has been going on for quite some time now but was sparked once again as a public debate following the murder of Sarah Everard March 3rd this year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to investigate whether these issues are only dicussed among women, and if in fact men participate in the conversation, how many participate and to what extend do they contribute to the conversation. The project will also investigate whether the language used about violenece against women differ between the genders. \n",
    "\n",
    "A goal adjacent to the main investigation goals of this project is to expose the reader to the conversation about women's safety. Our work might get the reader to reflect upon these issues in our society and the reader might participate in the conversation in the future. The more people who talk about the issues, the more people might help change and solve the issues. \n",

    "# 2. Basic statistics and data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collecting data\n",
    "Firstly the data was gathered by using the Twitter API and two developer Twitter accounts. Data was collected to create two data sets, which will be named as the Sarah-data and the Random-data. The Sarah-data is queried by the key word Saraheverard and the Random-data is queried by the neutral pronoun I i.e. queried by key word I. The Random-data is gathered to be able to account and balance the analysis of the Sarah-data to the general language on twitter. The procedure can be seen in the notebook Data_Collection.ipynb in the appended files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning data \n",
    "We cleaned the data by removing variables not necessary for the following data analysis. First, all the data concerning the users were arranged in a one column dataframe, where each row contained one user and all data concerning this user. We then unfolded the data i.e. extracted variables and created columns with each variable to more easily remove the unnecessary variables. This cleaned dataframe was then saved for inferring gender and further analysis. We also cleaned the time data to easily process the dates and create graphs showing the timeline of the events that undfolded during the twitter activity. The procedure can be seen in the notebook Data_Cleaning.ipynb in the appended files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing data\n",
    "The gender was inferred with the gender API called M3Inference. The gender is inferred on the Sarah-Data and the Random-data seperatly. The gender was then added to the already existing dataframe as the column predicted_gender. The code for this can be found in the notebook Data_Cleaning.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data statistics \n",
    "After data inferring gender the entire Sarah-Data contains 23146 rows × 16 columns and has the size 44.5 MB, while the entire Random-Data contains 36228 rows × 16 columns and has the size 45.9 MB. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Sarah-data the women constitute approximately 53%  of the users, with 7897 women and 7062 men. This was what we expected, but the difference is not as large as we initially thought. For the radom network the distribution is a bit more skewed and with male being the dominant gender of the users. To be noted is that these users are more diversed in geographical location. The Sara-users are mainly located in the United Kingdom (see _text analysis.ipynb_ for further analysis). In the Random-Data the distribution between the genders are 9624 men and 7885 women making the men the dominant user-group with 55% of the users being male. \n",

    "> - Talk about how you've worked with text, including regular expressions, unicode, etc.\n",
    "> - Describe which network science tools and data analysis strategies you've used, how those network science measures work, and why the tools you've chosen are right for the problem you're solving.\n",
    "> - How did you use the tools to understand your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The work with text \n",
    "### Twitter API (searchtweets)\n",
    "We were lucky enough to get access to the Twitter API. We recieved two developer account permissions, but unfortunatley not the academic permission, which would have given us access to historical data. We could therefore only go 30 days back on each of our data pulls. This resulted in us not being able to extract tweets from the day of the murder, but the days following the events of the murder. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API creates a stream of tweets from a rule. The rule to gather data related to Sarah Everard was \"saraheverrad\" resulting in getting tweets related to that keyword. The stream gather information of the user, time, tweet text, location and more. It also counts a retweet as a tweet, since there technically is a new author on this tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "The API from Twitter limits us in how many pull requests and tweets we can get each month. The limitations are set to 25.000 tweets every month and 250 pull requests, where the maximum tweets per pull request are 100 tweets. This limits our dataset significantly, since our data gathering from the first time pulling and second time pulling is within 30 days, creating an overlap in tweets pulled. We still managed to gather a lot of tweets, but this still limitied our maxmimum amount of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender Infering API\n",
    "One of our main issues with the data was that twitter users do not inform about their gender when creating an account. Therefore, we were forced to try to infer the gender upon the users. We used a python library called M3infernece to do so. M3inference takes a jsonl (json file seperated by new lines) as a user to predict. It is perfect for Twitter users, as the library needs serveral variables to predict a gender. It needs:\n",
    "> - id\n",
    "> - name\n",
    "> - screen_name\n",
    "> - description\n",
    "> - lang\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to predict upon the twitter picture, but due to time constrains, this was avoided. From this, the model predictes with percentages how sure it is in the user being a male or female. We then extracted the gender with the highest probability percentage and added that gender as a new column for the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Location\n",
    "From the extracted data, we could also retrive the location of the users. From these data, it was possible to see that the majority of our data belonged to users originating from the UK. To check against the baseline, we see a much more spread out locaion wise, which leads us to conclude that the conversation on the matter of Sarah Everad is mostly located in the UK. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Visulisation of the sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualising the words used and looking at sentiment in the text we used several tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wordclouds & Term Frequency\n",
    "Wordclouds are an easy way to visualise the most common tokens used across tweets. Our token representation are based on how much a tweet has been retweeted. Therefore, the same tweet may occur multiple times, but this is because many people share that opinon and wants to spread that message. We have presented wordclouds for both men and women to look at the differences between the words used. Funny enough, the keyword \"Saraheverard\" is the number one most frequent word for both men and female. This is because we only extract tweets related to Everard. The Term frequency is computed from generating the text into tokens, where stopwords and pronouns are removed. We therefore only get \"Terms\" and not links or other unwanted \"non\"-words as tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline of gathering\n",
    "A great deal of the challange was the data collection. We were denied Academic access to the twitter API, leaving us with only being able to extract tweets from a stream going 30 days back. Doing our data collection process, things also happend in the UK. For instance, Prince Phillip died on the 9th of april, leaving the UK in mourning. Debates related to sarah occured in this matter. The 17th of march, a vigil was planned for respecting Sarah Everad. Due to Corona restrictions, the police used violence to break off the vigil. The conflict arose again when it suddenly was deemed okay to gather in larger groups to mourn prince Phillip, creating a double standard for when to gather and mourn the dead and when not to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the day before our last data collection (3rd of may), a Woodland police officer by the name of Julia James was confirmed murderd at the age of 53 after her body was found the 27th of april. This again, sparked the conversation about womens saftey, even for women in the police. Therefore, a great spike in interatiction is seen again at the end of our collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The work with networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the networks \n",
    "As said, two data sets have been collected - one containing tweets related to Sarah Everard and one containing tweets sampled random from twitter. From these data sets 8 different online social networks have been visualized as graphs, and additionally one perfectly random network has been created. \n",
    "- #1 The entire Sarah-network\n",
    "- #2 The exclusively females of the Sarah-network\n",
    "- #3 The exclusively males of the Sarah-network\n",
    "- #4 The extended female Sarah-network\n",
    "- #5 The extended male Sarah-network\n",
    "- #6 The entire random network\n",
    "- #7 The exclusively females of the random network\n",
    "- #8 The exclusively males of the random network\n",
    "- #9 The perfect random network\n",
    "\n",
    "### The networks as graphs\n",
    "All networks have been created visually with the softwarepackage NetworkX for python. The first 8 graphs have been created from the collected data and subsets hereof, while the 9th network - the perfect random network - have been created as a binomial Erdős-Rényi graph based on the same properties as the entire Sarah-network. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important property to note regarding the creation of the female and male networks: the _male Sarah-network_ consists of male authors and both male and female parent authors. This is done to vizualise the reality of the male interaction, where males share ideas and opinions of females and the same goes for the oppisite example. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choices for the networks \n",
    "The nodes of the networks will be the users interacting in either the conversations surrounding the murder of Sarah or in random conversations. A link between two nodes is created if user A retweets user B. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project the act of retweeting is assumed to indicate a shared oppinion. This assumption is accepted based on statements such as  _\"(people) look for and retweet content that is credible, intelligent and valuable to them\"_ (https://ignitevisibility.com/retweet-what-makes-people-share/) and _\"Within the Twitter community a 'Retweet' is a social gesture indicating endorsement of an idea\"_ (https://web-strategist.com/blog/2008/11/23/retweet-the-infectious-power-of-the-word-of-mouth/). This premise of conversation and like-mindedness is the foundation for the network analysis, but the original idea was to get access to the comments of a tweet. This model is thought to create better insight in the conversation but it have not been possible to obtain access to the comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason for making the graphs undirected and acyclic graphs, and the edges in the graphs are weighted proportionally to the frequency by which they are retweeted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution of degrees \n",
    "\n",
    "The measuring and plotting of degree distributions were done in order to understand the arcitecture of the networks better. This can reveal whether a network is of the same structure as most social networks, and if it infact is a small world network with the property of a power law degree distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation of degree distributions revealed the random twitter data to actually not be random at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Average degree, standard deviation of the degrees and the max degree were also calculated and used to accompany each other and better understand the networks. The approximately equal average degrees showed huge differnces in the variation of degrees with max degrees varying from 10.00 to 9395.00. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The average shortest path length\n",
    "\n",
    "This measurement of the average shortest path length is calculated by finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes, adding them up, and then dividing by the total number of pairs (https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hrb281/SocialTies.html). One of the primary characteristics of the small world networks is a short \"average shortest path length\". This is a value relative to the size of the system, N. The \"rule of thumb\" value for the average shortest path length is 6, and since the Sarah-network's value is 3.842 i.e. a value below 6, we conclude the network to be a small world network. This was the expected conclusion since the network is a empirical real world network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a counterpart for this conclusion we would expect the random generated network to have an \"average shortest path length\" larger than 6, and this is exactly the observed case with a value of 11.537.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster coefficients \n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster coefficient is a measure of the degree of which the nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. This measure is used to investigate how closely the nodes are connected in the subgraphs of exclusive genders and in the entire network. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expected the cluster coefficient of the random Twitter network to be lower than for the entire Sarah data. This was also exactly what we observed. The smaller cluster coefficient of the random-network indicates that the network is comprised of numerous weak ties, and the high clustering coefficient of the Sarah-network indicates it being a small world. Both observations are supported by the other analysis done. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The observed cluster coefficient is larger than the analytical for the entire Sarah Network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the cluster coefficient, the closer the neighbors are. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the cluster coefficient of the exclusive male network is seen to be larger  -->\n",

    "# 4. Discussion. Think critically about your creation\n",
    "\n",
    "## What went well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we think alot went well when taking the many obstacles we have met along the way into account. The setup of developer accounts and the actual usage of the API and gender inferring definitely gave us headaches. We are very satisfied with the fact that we managed to collect the large amount of both Sarah data and random Twitter data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we are satisfied with the way we managed to represent the Twitter Data and the language used in the tweets, against the random baseline of what is typically written. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the creation of networks of males and females in the Sarah data we have have revealed insight on how people communicate with each other and how both male and female users interract together in the conversation about Sarah more than they do in general on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have shed light on the rhetoric used by the genders with visually detailed wordclouds, accompanied by the term frequency, and we have revealed the most important key words in the discussion for both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What could be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above the data collection process and the preprocessing of data were rough. To have greater confidence in our analysis and results we would ideally need more data e.g. more tweets and also the comments to each tweet. This was unfortunatley not possible. On the other hand, if we had changed to a website which would have been easier to collect data from, like Reddit, we would have trouble infering the gender of the users. We are therefore happy with our choice of data source, and we would only improve our process of data collection by extending the timeframe for collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it was a shame we weren't allowed access to the academic accounts we applied for. This would have allowed us to freely look further back in time and analyse key moments as the time of Sarah's murder and the vigil, which were heavily discussed on Twitter even many dayes after. "
